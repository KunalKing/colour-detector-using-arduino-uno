# colour-detector-using-arduino-uno

In this projectI am going to interface TCS3200 color sensor with Arduino UNO. TCS3200 is a color sensor which can detect any number of colors with right 
programming. TCS3200 contains RGB (Red Green Blue) arrays. On microscopic level one can see the square boxes inside the eye on sensor. 
These square boxes are arrays of RGB matrix. Each of these boxes contain Three sensors, One is for sensing RED light intensity, One is for sensing GREEN light 
intensity and the last in for sensing BLUE light intensity.
